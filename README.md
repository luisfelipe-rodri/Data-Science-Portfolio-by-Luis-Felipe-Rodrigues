     * [Machine Learning and the Architecture of Choice](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-and-the-architecture-of-choice-2cc69072a45b): The contribution of behavioral economics to evaluate the way machine learning makes us made decisions and their ethical implication.

   * ## Supervised Learning

      * Predict energy comsumption: comparing five types of regressive models to predict the energy consumption from brazilian southeast region.

   * ## Unsupervised Learning
 
      * [Mapping Sales Hotspots and Outliers Detection](https://l-f-rodrigues.medium.com/mapping-sales-hotspots-and-outliers-detection-ad34d6e47a68): The objective of the project is to identify sales hotspots based on density points. Thus, locate conglomerate cities on the map that represent a high volume of sales.
